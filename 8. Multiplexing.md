# Multiplexing

In the last chapter we implemented a machine, `Add4`, which added two nybbles together. We then realized that dealing directly with wires was a pretty terrible experience, so we invented the concept of a *multiwire* – a group of wires that acts as one. We made up some semantics for how these things interface with machines – either directly inputting all of their wires, or by making a copy of every machine they touch.

The last few chapters have been a long stretch of working with numbers, and you’re probably sick of them. Let’s take a break in this chapter, and without further ado, build some tools to help us work with multiwires.

A New Machine
-------------

The first machine we’ll build is called `Split`, and it divides a (single) wire into its value and the `not` of its value.

`Split` is super simple – a nice break from what we’ve been doing lately, no? But why is it useful? As usual, it’s not useful in-and-of-itself, but just a stepping stone in the implementation of something more useful. We call these “less-than-useful” machines **lemma machines**, because a **lemma** is something you make solely to be used to make something else.

> Takeaway: A **lemma** is something you make in order to use it to make something else.

What, you might be wondering, will we use this *lemma machine* for? Well, it’s called `Demux2`, and it looks like this:

Spend a minute or two convincing yourself that you know what this machine does before reading on.

`Demux2` takes a multiwire input `A`, annotated as `n`. What is this `n`? Well, it’s not anything *specific*. It’s a placeholder for any particular multiwire; this machine doesn’t care what multiwire is coming into it, so we use the placeholder `n` to say “give me anything you got”. We say that a multiwire with such a placeholder annotation is **polymorphic**.

> Takeaway: A multiwire without a specific annotation is called **polymorphic**, which means it can take *any* annotation. Any machine which takes such a multiwire is also said to be *polymorphic*.

Note that there is nothing special about the annotation `n` – it could just as well be `a`, or `x`. We will treat any annotation that is one-letter long and all lowercase as a *polymorphic* annotation. When you make this machine, you can substitute `n` with any annotation you please, so long as you change *all of the `n`s* at the same time. That means the output wires, because they’re also labeled `n`, must *always* have the same annotation as the input wire. If we wanted the outputs to have a different annotation than the input, we’d need to use a different letter to annotate them – maybe `j` or something like that.

Back to `Demux2`. The other input to this machine is a (single) wire `D` (short for “destination”), which `Split`s and then is `and`ed against the contents of multiwire. Whenever a wire is `and`ed against value 1, its value passes through untouched; likewise, `and`ing against value 0 will always output a 0. As a result, pushing our multiwire through these `Split`ed `and` gates, acts like a “filter” – a copy of the multiwire input will be made *either* on the top multiwire, *or* on the bottom one. The other multiwire will have 0s on all of its wires.

> Takeaway: Any wire `and`ed against a 1 moves its value through the gate.

So `Demux2` allows us to take a signal and move it to one of two wires, depending on an input signal. You can think of this like a traffic fork – either your car goes one way, or it goes the other. It can’t go down both lanes simultaneously (unless you are particularly unlucky that day). This metaphor is enticing, because it suggests another machine, namely a traffic *merge*. Let’s build that next.

`Mux2`, as you might expect, is the opposite of `Demux2`. It takes two polymorphic (but annotated the same) multiwires `A` and `B`, choses *one* of them via the value of `S` (short for “source”), and moves it to the output. Whenever a wire is `or`ed against a 0, its value moves through the `or` gate, so because we’ve filtered one of our multiwires all the way to 0, the other successfully passes through the `or` gate.

> Takeaway: Any wire `or`ed against a 0 moves its value through the gate.

While a `Demux2` allows us to move a multiwire to one of two locations, based on a `D`estination, `Mux2` lets us choose a `S`ource multiwire and move it to a single output. `Demux2` can selectively *send* information somewhere, while `Mux2` can selectively *read* information.

Study these two gates well, because we’ll get lots of mileage out of them as we move forward into the actual implementation of a computer. It might not feel like it, but we’ve already built most of the pieces we’ll need in order to *actually get some real work done*. Exciting, no?

In the next chapter, we’ll investigate how to make machines that *change over time*, which will be the basis for us to *store information*. From there it’s just a short hop to actual computers!

Exercises
---------

1.  Design `Mux4` and `Demux4`, which take a multiwire annotated as `2` (ie. two wires) and uses it to switch from/to four different multiwires.
